I have been given two plasmid sequence, so, using addgene plasmid map maker I can directly find out what are the components/protein is in it is.
After getting plasmid map,
1. Interesting features/genes: TEM beta lactamase gene as a ampicillin resistant marker gene
                               lactose operon oppressor
                               red fluorescent gene
                               green fluorescent gene
