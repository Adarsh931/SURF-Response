I have been given two plasmid sequence, so, using addgene plasmid map maker I can directly find out what are the components/protein is in it is. From plasmid map, it was evident that contained 4 proteins and after doing BLAST following result was concluded. 
1. Interesting features/genes: - TEM beta lactamase gene as a ampicillin resistant marker gene
                               - lactose operon oppressor
                               - red fluorescent gene
                               - green fluorescent gene (already was shown in
